SELENIUM NOTES

1) what is selenium
-> 	it is  opern source automation test suite for web based application across different browser and different platform.
-> 	it support multiple programming languages like java, ruby, python.

2) component of selenium
->	Selenium Software is not just a single tool but a suite of software, each piece catering to different Selenium QA testing needs of an organization. Here is the list of tools

	a) Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
	b) Selenium Remote Control (RC)
	c) WebDriver
	d) Selenium Grid

3) what is selenium IDE
-> 	Selenium IDE stands for Intregrated Developement Environment
-> 	It is simple and easy to used
-> 	It is used  as prototyping tool
-> 	No prior programming knowledge is required
-> 	No advanced testing can do in IDE

4) What is selenium web driver
-> 	it is a component of selenium suite
-> 	it is a java interface implemented by browser classes
-> 	it is an API(Application Programming Interface) mediator between browser and client libraries
-> 	it has various commands to interact with web elements

5) What is selenium grid
-> 	It allow test cases to run parallelly in 
		a) different machines 
		b) different plaforms 
		c) different browers

6) Advantages of selenium web driver
-> 	it is a open source tool
-> 	it supports multiple browers like (Firefox, Chrome, Opera etc.)
-> 	it supports multiple platforms like (Windows, Linux, MacOs etc.)
-> 	it supports multiple languages like (Java, Ruby, Python etc.)

7) Dis-advantages of selenium web driver
-> 	it support web based application doesn't support window based application
-> 	it does not have reporting feature
-> 	it does not provide facilty for data driven testing

Third Party Tools To Overcome Disadvantages
-> 	Windows Operation - Autoit
-> 	Data Driven testing - Apache POI
-> 	Reporting - Extent Report

8) BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)
-> BDD is a development approach that involves collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders. It encourages writing test cases in a natural language that non-technical stakeholders can understand. This approach uses tools like Cucumber and Gherkin.

9) Use of Driver in Selenium
-> The WebDriver is used to control the browser. It can be used to open, navigate, and interact with web pages.

10) What is the page factory Why do we use it?
-> Page Factory is a class in Selenium that supports the Page Object Model design pattern. It helps to initialize elements of a Page Object class

11)Fluent Wait is used to define the maximum amount of time to wait for a condition and the frequency with which to check the condition.

12) What is locator in selenium ?

-> Locators in Selenium are used to identify web elements on a webpage for automation testing purposes.
-> Locators include ID, class name, name, tag name, link text, partial link text, and xpath.
-> ID is the most efficient locator as it is unique for each element.
-> Xpath is powerful but can be slow and brittle if not used correctly.
-> Using CSS selectors is preferred over xpath for better performance.
-> Locators can be used with findElement() and findElements() methods in Selenium.

13) What is the scenario outline ?
-> A Scenario Outline in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is used to run the same scenario multiple times with different sets of input data.
